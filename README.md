Hi,

I'm Torben Sell, a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, UK, specialising in Bayesian computational methodology (in particular sampling methods, MCMC, function space priors).

If you have any questions on any of my repos, feel free to email me at t.sell at maths.cam.ac.uk 

Take care and be kind!
